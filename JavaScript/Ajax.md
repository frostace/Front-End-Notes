# Ajax

## What is Ajax

Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) describes a new approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including HTML or XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, [XML](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp), XSLT and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object.

It can communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page.

## Major features:

* Make requests to the server without reloading the page
* Receive and work with data from the server
