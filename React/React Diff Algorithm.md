## Assumptions

1. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
2. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a `key` prop.

TODO: read diff algo source code and fill in the following sections with well structured contents and figures

### Elements of Different Types (DOM / Component)

### DOM Elements of the Same Type

### Component Elements of the Same Type

### Recursing on Children
