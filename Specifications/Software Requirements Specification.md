# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Why SRS

### Goals:

* software customers to accurately describe what they wish to obtain
* software suppliers to understand exactly what the customer wants
* individuals to accomplish the following goals:
  * develop a standard software requirements specification outline for their own organizations
  * define the format and content of their specific software requirements specifications
  * develop additional local supporting items such as an SRS quality checklist, or an SRS writer's handbook

### Benefits

* Establish the basis for agreement between the customers and the suppliers on what the software product is to do
* Reduce the development effort
* Provide a basis for estimating costs and schedules
* Provide a baseline for validation and veriÔ¨Åcation
* Facilitate transfer
* Serve as a basis for enhancement

## 2. Consideration for producing a good SRS

### 2.1 Nature of the SRS

* Functionality
* External Interfaces
* Performance
* Attributes
* Design Constraints Imposed on an Implementation

Note: Avoid placing either design or project requirements in the SRS

### 2.2 Role of the SRS

* should correctly define all of the software requirements. A software requirement may exist because of the nature of the task to be solved or because of a special characteristic of the project.
* should not describe any design or implementation details. These should be described in the design stage of the project.
* should not impose additional constraints on the software. These are properly specified in other documents such as a software quality assurance plan.

### 2.3 Characteristics of a good SRS

* correct
* unambiguous
* complete
* consistent
* ranked for importance and / or stability
* verifiable
* modifiable
* traceable

### 2.4 Embedding

* Design Items:
  * Partitioning the software into modules
  * Allocating functions to the modules
  * Describing the flow of information or control between modules
  * Choosing data structure
* Security Requirements:
  * Keep certain functions in separate modules
  * Permit only limited communication between some areas of the program
  * Check data integrity for critical variables
* Project Requirements:
  * Cost
  * Delivery schedule
  * Reporting procedures
  * Software development methods
  * Quality assurance
  * Validation and verification criteria
  * Acceptance procedures
