package name: axios

> https://github.com/axios/axios

I found it would be much easier to take notes in English with Vim.

# WHAT FOR

It's a `Promise based` HTTP client for browser and node.js
The outline is quite long, but the main procedure is straight forward, I think I should be focusing on:

-   API
-   Axios Instance
-   Request Config
-   Interceptors
-   Error Handling
-   Cancellation

axios main features:

-   Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
-   Make http requests from node.js
-   Supports the Promise API
-   Intercept request and response
-   Transform request and response data
-   Cancel requests
-   Automatic transforms for JSON data
-   Client side support for protecting against XSRF
